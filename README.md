# Muti-view Mouse Social Behaviour Recognition with Deep Graphic Model
### Introduction

Home-cage  social  behaviour  analysis  of  mice  is  aninvaluable tool to assess therapeutic efficacy of neurodegenerativediseases.  Despite  tremendous  efforts  made  within  the  researchcommunity,  single-camera  video  recordings  are  mainly used  forsuch analysis. Because of the potential to create rich descriptionsfor mouse social behaviors, the use of multi-view video recordingsfor rodent observations is increasingly receiving much attention.Here, we release the code of our paper for Muti-view Mouse Social Behaviour Recognition.
